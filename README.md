# MVC-App

this APP is follows MVC Pattern :
1- Servlets for the Controller part
2- jsp for the View Part
3- Hibernate for the Model part

the App is for any login/register website but it contains small data to be enetered ( first name , last name , ..... ) 
you can make your own databas in mysql and change :
1- configuration in the Hibernate.cfg.xml 
2- add your own data in the User.java class 
3- change the loginServlet and Register Servlet

Happy Coding :)
